# 🧪 Hypothesis Testing in Python

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains a detailed walkthrough of hypothesis testing using real-world examples in Python. It covers both **proportion tests** and **mean tests** using **Z-tests** and **T-tests**. Each scenario includes complete hypothesis formulation, visualization, test statistic calculation, and interpretation of results.

- Null and Alternative Hypotheses
- One-Tailed Tests (Left and Right)
- Critical Regions and p-values
- Z-Tests for known population standard deviation
- T-Tests for unknown population standard deviation
- Visualizations of test statistics and rejection regions
